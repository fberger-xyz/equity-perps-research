# Regulatory Compliance

## Overview

Unit Protocol maintains strict regulatory compliance to ensure the integrity and legality of its operations. This document outlines the comprehensive compliance measures implemented across the protocol.

## Key Compliance Measures

### Sanctions Screening and Blocking

Unit Protocol employs sophisticated blockchain analytics and intelligence software to maintain compliance:

- **OFAC Compliance**: Screens all transactions against Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions lists
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of sanctioned entity lists
- **Automatic Blocking**: Prevents known sanctioned entities from interacting with the network
- **Regular Updates**: Sanctions lists are updated regularly to reflect current regulations

### Geographic Restrictions

The protocol implements comprehensive geographic controls:

- **IP-Based Geoblocking**: Restricts access from prohibited jurisdictions
- **VPN Detection**: Screens and blocks virtual private network (VPN) access attempts
- **Prohibited Jurisdictions**: As defined in the Terms of Service, certain jurisdictions are restricted from accessing the protocol
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Regular audits of geographic restriction effectiveness
