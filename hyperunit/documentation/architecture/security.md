# Unit Security Architecture

## Overview

Unit Protocol employs a comprehensive "defense in depth" security strategy with multiple layers of protection to ensure the safety of user assets and protocol integrity.

## Protocol Security Measures

The protocol employs a deterministic state machine with robust security controls:

### Transaction Security
- **Strict Workflow**: Transactions follow a deterministic, verifiable workflow
- **Independent Validation**: Each Guardian independently validates blockchain data, addresses, and transaction details
- **Rate Limiting**: Network endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse and DoS attacks
- **Circuit Breakers**: System-wide pausing capabilities if malicious activity is detected
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of all protocol operations

### Validation Framework
- Multi-layer validation at each protocol step
- Cross-Guardian verification of all critical operations
- Automated anomaly detection systems
- Manual override capabilities for emergency situations

## Consensus and Key Management

### MPC Threshold Signature Scheme

A 2-of-3 Multi-Party Computation (MPC) threshold signature scheme ensures secure operations:

#### Key Security Features
- **Majority Consent**: Requires majority Guardian agreement for critical protocol events
- **Distributed Keys**: No single party ever has access to complete private keys
- **Secure Storage**: Private key shares are:
  - Encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption
  - Stored in secure hardware enclaves
  - Only combined at runtime for signing operations
  - Protected from memory dumps and side-channel attacks

#### Key Generation and Management
- Distributed key generation protocol ensures no single party knows the full key
- Regular key rotation schedules
- Secure key resharing protocols for Guardian changes
- Emergency key recovery procedures

## Communication Security

Guardian communication is designed with multiple protective layers:

### Encryption and Authentication
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All Guardian-to-Guardian transmissions are encrypted
- **Identity Verification**: Out-of-band ID verification prevents impersonation attacks
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: No implicit trust between components
- **Certificate Pinning**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks

### Network Security
- **Isolated Networks**: Relay servers operate on isolated network segments
- **No Key Storage**: Relay servers do not store any cryptographic material
- **Redundancy**: Network remains secure even if relay infrastructure fails
- **DDoS Protection**: Multiple layers of DDoS mitigation

## Build and Runtime Integrity

### Configuration Management
Comprehensive integrity checks include:
- **Hash Validation**: Hash-based configuration validation ensures consistency
- **Secure Distribution**: Public key distribution through authenticated channels
- **Version Control**: Manual verification of deployment versions
- **Configuration Enforcement**: Consistent runtime configuration across all Guardians

### Code Security
- Open-source codebase for transparency
- Regular security audits by independent firms
- Formal verification of critical components
- Continuous integration with security scanning

## Validation Procedures

### Distributed Validation Model

The security model relies on distributed, independent validation:

#### Blockchain Monitoring
- Each Guardian runs independent blockchain nodes
- Cross-validation of blockchain state
- Detection of chain reorganizations
- Alert systems for anomalous activity

#### Audit and Compliance
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All operations logged for audit trails
- **Immutable Records**: Tamper-proof log storage
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring dashboards
- **Compliance Checks**: Automated compliance validation

## Attack Mitigation

### Common Attack Vectors and Defenses

#### Double Spending Prevention
- Multiple confirmation requirements per chain
- Cross-Guardian validation of deposits
- Automatic detection of conflicting transactions

#### Sybil Attack Protection
- Permissioned Guardian set
- Stake-based participation requirements
- Performance monitoring and slashing

#### Replay Attack Prevention
- Unique nonces for all transactions
- Time-bound operation windows
- Chain-specific transaction formats

## Incident Response

### Emergency Procedures
- **Pause Mechanism**: Ability to pause protocol operations
- **Guardian Coordination**: Established communication channels for emergencies
- **Recovery Protocols**: Documented procedures for various failure scenarios
- **Post-Incident Analysis**: Mandatory review after any security incident

### Monitoring and Alerting
- 24/7 monitoring of protocol operations
- Automated alerting for suspicious activities
- Escalation procedures for critical issues
- Regular security drills and simulations

## Security Audits

### Audit Schedule
- Initial audit before mainnet launch
- Regular audits every 6 months
- Additional audits for major upgrades
- Continuous bug bounty program

### Audit Scope
- Smart contract security
- MPC implementation correctness
- Network security assessment
- Operational security review

## Best Practices for Users

### Recommended Security Measures
1. Verify deposit addresses through multiple channels
2. Use hardware wallets for large transactions
3. Enable all available security features
4. Monitor transactions on blockchain explorers
5. Report suspicious activity immediately
